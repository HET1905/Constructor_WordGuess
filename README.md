# Constructor_WordGuess



Constructor_WordGuess is a Node,JavaScript Word Guess command-line game using Constructor functions. Here I used Fruits names to guess.

## How the game works.

* Run the index.js file on Terminal.
* It will prompt for any letter to guess. TotalGuess is for 10 letters.
* If entered letter is right then it will replace - with the entered  letter and reduce TotalGuess by  1.
* If the word is guessed before running out of TotalGuess, it will display Win message and prompt for Play again.
